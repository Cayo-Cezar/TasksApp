# Tasks Management API with ASP.NET and C#

This project is a complete RESTful API designed for managing tasks with a focus on scalability, security, and maintainability. It adheres to modern development practices and architectural patterns, utilizing widely adopted technologies in the industry. The API was built to be robust, efficient, and easy to maintain, featuring functionalities such as authentication, authorization, data validation, and database access.

The API supports complete task management, enabling Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. Routes and HTTP verbs are configured properly to follow REST principles. To ensure security, JWT-based authentication was implemented, along with role- and permission-based access control. The project also validates input data using Fluent Validation, providing clear and user-friendly error messages.
